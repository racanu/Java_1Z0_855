Why a Map is used for the data store and not a List

Cannot use a List for the data store because deleting records would change the record numbers and these are used in the
interface to identify records. A client may theoretically cache record numbers that would become invalid as records are deleted by other
client. It is however acceptable to assign different record numbers when the server starts again, therefore it is not necessary
to persist the record numbers in the database. 

Why ExcursionPrimaryKey HAS-A Excursion and not IS-A Excursion or Excursion IS-A ExcursionPrimaryKey 

Although intimately linked to Excursion
- the primary key is not so much a property of the record as it is a property of the list which the record is part of
(i.e. one can construct different lists with different primary keys)
- the primary key is a thin wrapper around the data record, providing only the functionality needed to avoid duplicates and/or
to sort the records in the list.
- the records can be stored in a list by their original insertion order and one or more keys can be created for each record
and stored in separate lists that can be created and disposed of as needed;
