Used an "anemic" domain model, with "dumb" domain objects that are only used to contain the data and pass it between layers.

Chosen to also check the field names when validating schema.
Mismatches in field names may indicate wrong database.

Intentionally not implemented complex validation of room "rate" field.

There is no combination of fields that makes sense as primary key.
